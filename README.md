## Coding guidelines

- Get ready for changes (e.g. swapping Prisma to TypeORM, React to Svelte)
  - Make the code agnostic, use adapters for external libraries
- Separate domain logic code
  - Prevent leaking libraries into domain logic
- Provide a single point of communication with modules
  - Export clear API methods (I/O)
  - Treat the communication similarly to a government bureaucracy
    - Provide forms for applicants and validate those forms (within API methods)
